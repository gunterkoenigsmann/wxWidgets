/*
 * Regression tests for the GTK4 platform behaviour the wxGTK4 port relies on.
 *
 * These are not tests of wxWidgets code. They pin down assumptions about GTK
 * itself -- how its widget tree is shaped, how style resolution works, how
 * widget ownership behaves -- which the port depends on and which a GTK
 * upgrade could change silently. The failure mode being guarded against is
 * not a crash but a wrong number: if GtkNotebook's interior node structure
 * changes, wxGtkStyleContext keeps returning metrics, just the wrong ones.
 *
 * The reasoning behind each assumption is in docs/gtk/gtk4-stylecontext-design.md,
 * and the exploratory programs they came from are in docs/gtk/probes/.
 *
 * Deliberately asserts STRUCTURE, not pixel values. Exact metrics and colours
 * are theme-dependent, so asserting them would make this fail whenever CI's
 * theme differs rather than when something is actually wrong. Checks that are
 * inherently theme-dependent report but do not fail; they are marked SOFT.
 *
 * This is a standalone program rather than a Catch2 case in tests/ because it
 * needs only GTK, not libwx: the GUI test binary (test_gui) cannot link until
 * the GTK4 port compiles far enough, and these invariants are worth guarding
 * before then. Once test_gui links, this should move into the normal suite.
 *
 * Build and run (a display is required -- widgets need a GdkDisplay even
 * though they are never shown):
 *     gcc -o gtk4-invariants gtk4-invariants.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk4)
 *     xvfb-run -a ./gtk4-invariants
 *
 * Exits 0 if every hard invariant holds, 1 otherwise.
